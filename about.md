My name is James Simpson. I've done a lot of things in my life, from English 
teaching, to journalism, asbestos analysis and running an online store. But when 
I turned 30 just days after my father's death, I realised that none of these things 
were what I really wanted to do as a career. 

I had learned a bit of Ruby at that point, and I was using it to solve a problem.
How do you serve a dynamic-seeming storefront on a domain that will not allow 
custom Javascript to run and operated with iframes when you left the front page -- 
all with no inherent access to the database of products maintained by the site. 
My answer was a hourly cron job that ran a Ruby script that scraped from the host 
service's product and store APIs, collated the data into rows of products and 
interspersed user-defined banner data that can be easily changed as CSV files. 
The outcome was [a storefront that changed each hour to present top ranking products,
new reviews, updated category pages and more](https://www.rakuten.ne.jp/gold/ij-pets/). 

That was my introduction to the power of programming. Since then I have completed 
[Harvard University's CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), 
creating [a movie recommendation site](https://github.com/jamesinjapan/watchlist) 
based on the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and have been working on a 
laboratory information management system in my day job.

This blog will be a place to discuss challenges and solutions, new and ongoing 
projects, and my efforts towards finding a career in backend development.
